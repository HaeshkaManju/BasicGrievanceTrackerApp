# BasicGrievanceTrackerApp
Developed for use by the National Association of Letter Carriers - specifically the Orem Branch in Utah, USA.  However, with some tweaking, this code may work for other unions.

There is an executable version available.  Please contact me directly if you would like to use this for your union.

This Basic App is setup to perform the following:

1) Allow Unions to attach files (usually PDFs), that will be saved into a database. (offline)
2) Allows User to lookup files by the given filename.
3) Allows User to add keywords and other search terminology to files.
4) Allows User to associate employee names and citations (think keywords such as: Safety, Payroll, etc) to files.
5) Presents graphics that handle by-year metrics.

If you are working for a Union, you are free to download the files, access the content, and use it to make your paperwork easier to manage.

If you need further support (more features), I am always happy to help and look into it.
